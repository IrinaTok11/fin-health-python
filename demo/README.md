# Demo

This folder contains **instructions** for capturing portfolio screenshots.  
We intentionally **do not** store extra Excel workbooks here to keep the rule: *run with exactly one `.xlsx` in `run/`*.

---

## What we show in the portfolio
- **Summary — before** (empty/initial sheet).  
- **Summary — after** (generated by the script).  
- **Word, option 1 (v1, Python only)** — section 3.2 as generated (table + narrative), page 1 and page 2.  
- **Word, option 2 (v2, Python + visuals)** — the same section after you **manually insert** selected Power BI charts, page 1 and page 2.

Target file names in `/assets`:
```
assets/
├─ 00_summary_before.png
├─ 01_summary_after.png
├─ 02_word_v1_page1.png
├─ 03_word_v1_page2.png
├─ 04_word_v2_page1.png
└─ 05_word_v2_page2.png
```

---

## Prerequisites
- Place your input workbook into `run/` (**exactly one** `.xlsx` file).  
- Close the workbook in Excel (Windows locks open files).  
- Make sure **there is no** file named `3.2_analysis_of_liquidity_ratios.docx` in `run/` before you run the script.

## How to capture the screenshots

### 1) Summary — before
1. Open the workbook in `run/`.
2. Go to the **Summary** sheet (empty or initial state).
3. Take a screenshot and save as `assets/00_summary_before.png`.

### 2) Generate outputs
From the `run/` folder:
```bash
python summary.py
```
Result: the **Summary** sheet is rebuilt; the Word file `3.2_analysis_of_liquidity_ratios.docx` is created in `run/`.

### 3) Summary — after
1. Re-open (or switch to) the **Summary** sheet after the run.
2. Take a screenshot and save as `assets/01_summary_after.png`.

### 4) Word — option 1 (v1, Python only)
1. Open `run/3.2_analysis_of_liquidity_ratios.docx`.  
2. Take two screenshots (page 1 and page 2) **without** any extra visuals.  
3. Save as:
   - `assets/02_word_v1_page1.png`
   - `assets/03_word_v1_page2.png`

### 5) Word — option 2 (v2, Python + visuals)
1. In your Power BI project, prepare an **export page** for clean screenshots (no rounded corners, no background, 1-pt neutral border).  
2. Copy visuals **as images** and **manually paste** them into the relevant places in the Word narrative (section 3.2).  
3. Take two screenshots (page 1 and page 2) **with** visuals inserted.  
4. Save as:
   - `assets/04_word_v2_page1.png`
   - `assets/05_word_v2_page2.png`

## Quality tips (for crisp images)
- In Power BI use zoom **175–200%** before copying visuals; in Word set the page at **100%** when capturing.  
- Keep the same **image width** in Word (≈15.5–16 cm) and a consistent **1 pt border** (`#B8BEC3`) on all inserted visuals.  
- Use clear file names exactly as above; the root README relies on them.

## Do not commit sensitive data
- This folder is only for **instructions**; screenshots live in `/assets`.  
- Do **not** commit real client workbooks; use demo data only.
