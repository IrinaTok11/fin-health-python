# Case study: Liquidity reporting in practice

**Scope of the Word output (this repo)**  
The generated section **3.2 Analysis of liquidity ratios** covers **four liquidity KPIs**:
- **Cash ratio**
- **Current ratio**
- **Quick ratio**
- **Months to repay** (Current liabilities / average monthly revenue)

All **twelve** KPIs (across liquidity, financial stability and profitability) are computed and shown on the **Excel _Summary_ sheet**, but **only the liquidity subset** is exported into the Word narrative here.  
The remaining KPIs are analysed and visualised in the separate **Power BI** portfolio.

---

## Business questions this section answers
- Do we meet target **liquidity norms** (cash/current/quick) across the past three years?
- How quickly can we cover **current liabilities** with **average monthly revenue** (“Months to repay”)?
- Are movements directionally **better** or **worse** versus the benchmark bias (“higher/lower/between”)?
- What **actions** reduce short-term risk (working-capital policy, inventory, and payables/receivables terms)?

---

## Assumptions
- Uses standardised `ratio_norms` for comparability across clients and periods.
- Requires **three consecutive fiscal years** with a consistent statement structure.
- Financial stability and profitability KPIs are computed for context on the Excel Summary but are **out of scope** for the Word narrative in this repository.

---

## Deliverables
1) **Excel Summary** with **12 KPIs** (norms, trends, deltas) — formatted and decision-ready.  
2) **Word section 3.2** with the **four liquidity KPIs** — captioned table and narrative (overall assessment, observations, actions).

---

## Interpretation tips for management
- Ratios within benchmark ranges **do not guarantee** cash sufficiency — always review **Months to repay** alongside cash levels.
- A rising **Current ratio** with a flat **Quick ratio** may indicate inventory build-up and potential liquidity risk.
- If **Debt-to-equity** climbs whilst **working capital** falls, the balance sheet becomes more fragile — monitor covenants and refinancing windows.

## Word variants shown in the portfolio
- **v1 (Python only):** section 3.2 exactly as generated by the script (captioned table + narrative).  
- **v2 (Python + visuals):** the same section **after** manually inserting selected Power BI charts into the narrative for presentation purposes.  
- The underlying numbers are identical; **only the layout differs**.
