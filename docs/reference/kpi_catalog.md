# KPI catalog

| KPI | Formula (conceptual) | Typical benchmark | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cash ratio | Cash / Current liabilities | 0.2–0.5 | Practical range 0.2–0.5; <0.2 = tight cash; ≫1.0 may indicate idle liquidity. |
| Current ratio | Current assets / Current liabilities | 1.0–2.0 | 1–2 is prudent; ≫2 can signal slow inventory or excess working capital. |
| Quick ratio | (Current assets – Inventories) / Current liabilities | ≥ 0.8 | Excludes inventories; <0.8 = tight; ≈1.0 typically comfortable. |
| Months to repay | Current liabilities / (Revenue / 12) | < 3 months | Use LTM revenue; <3 months good, 3–6 watchlist, >6 red flag. |
| Equity ratio | Equity / Total assets | ≥ 50% | Share of assets financed by equity; <30% fragile; negative equity triggers solvency warnings. |
| Debt-to-equity | Total debt / Equity | 0–0.8 | >1 = high leverage; **N/A if equity ≤ 0**. |
| Working capital | Current assets – Current liabilities | ≥ 0 (positive) | Negative indicates a working‑capital deficit; rising trend strengthens liquidity. |
| Altman index | 1.2×(Working capital/Total assets) + 1.4×(Retained earnings/Total assets) + 3.3×(EBIT/Total assets) + 0.6×(Market value of equity/Total liabilities) + 1.0×(Sales/Total assets) | ≥ 2.6 | Thresholds vary by model/sector; interpret alongside other signals and industry norms. |
| ROA | Net income / Total assets | ≥ 5% | Sector-dependent; rising ROA with stable assets signals efficiency gains. |
| ROE | Net income / Equity | ≥ 10% | Watch leverage effect: high ROE with high D/E may be risk-driven. |
| Net profit margin | Net income / Revenue | ≥ 10% | Compare with industry peers; persistent <0% indicates structural issues. |
| EBITDA margin | EBITDA / Revenue | ≥ 20% | Operating performance proxy; capital-intensive sectors show lower baselines. |
